# Automobile Market in Armenia<br>


 <p>  &nbsp In Armenia, we do not have a statistic-based study publicly available on the automobile market. Moreover, there is no reliable data on this market, hence this makes even more difficult to analyze the market and make accurate assumptions on the automobile market.<br>
 &nbsp At the moment, people make conclusions based on approximate data. In majority of cases, people tend to compare their cars with several similar auto models or they set the price based on parameters of an automobile and their own experience. However, the noted approaches may cause errors both for the sellers and buyers and they are not able to predict if their cars are able to be sold for a certain price. <br>
	 &nbsp In this project we have collected the necessary data on the automobile market of Armenia and have analyzed it by using different statistical tools. With several extra techniques we have made the acquired data more reliable and have decreased possible deviations in the stage of analysis. As a result, we have created quite an effective tool for both sellers and buyers, which helps them to decide the market price of the car, calculates the possibility of the cars to be sold.<br>
